The total time taken for executing all the 400 puzzles in the file is 26.88 seconds 
This behaviour of AC3 was not expected as just 3 puzzles were solved from 400 ones 


Backtracking: 
All the puzzles were solved using Backtracking. MRV was used to choose the next unassigned variable and forward checking was used to reduce the size of the domain.
The running time per puzzle was around 15-20 seconds.
